# GNNEPCSAFT MCP Server

## What is GNNEPCSAFT MCP Server?

GNNEPCSAFT MCP Server is an implementation of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for [GNNePCSAFT](https://github.com/wildsonbbl/gnnepcsaft) tools. It enables seamless communication and context management between large language models (LLMs) and clients for advanced thermodynamic calculations. GNNePCSAFT leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to estimate [PC-SAFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-SAFT) parameters, allowing property predictions such as density and vapor pressure for any molecule, even without experimental data. [FeOS](https://github.com/feos-org/feos) is used for PC-SAFT calculations.
